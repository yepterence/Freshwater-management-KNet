# Freshwater-management-KNet
### Business case
The purpose of this project is to define model to predict freshwater levels for a defined geographical region. Doing so can potentially help us with a variety of applications that are currently under-served:
+ Flood prediction - which could help avert loss of wildlife/aquatic life, 
+ Hydropower operation 
+ Predicting drought conditions
+ May help with answering how surface water contributes to groundwater
